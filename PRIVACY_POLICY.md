This privacy policy applies to the Octostack app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by Ander Goig (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Commercial service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".

**Information Collection and Use**

The Application does **not** collect any personally identifiable information from users. It does not require user accounts, request personal details, or store sensitive data on any server.

The Application may collect limited, anonymized usage data through third-party services. This information may include:

 • Your device's Internet Protocol address (e.g. IP address)  
 • The operating system and model of your mobile device  
 • App version and configuration  
 • Screens viewed and time spent within the Application  
 • Crash reports and error logs  

This data is collected in aggregate form and cannot be used to personally identify you.

The Application does **not** gather precise or approximate location information from your device.

The Service Provider may use the aggregated information to improve the performance, stability, and functionality of the Application.

**Third Party Access**

Only anonymized, non-identifiable data is periodically transmitted to external services to aid the Service Provider in maintaining and improving the Application.

Please note that the Application utilizes third-party services that have their own Privacy Policy about handling data. Below are the links to the Privacy Policy of the third-party service providers used by the Application:

 • [Google Analytics for Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy)  
 • [Firebase Crashlytics](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy/)  
 • [RevenueCat](https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy)

The Service Provider may disclose anonymized data:

 • as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process;  
 • when believed in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect rights, user safety, or respond to a government request;  
 • with trusted service providers who assist in app improvement and have agreed to adhere to this privacy policy.

**User-Generated Content**

The Application allows you to interact with the Stack Exchange network via its public API. These interactions (such as viewing, voting, or flagging content) are processed securely through the Stack Exchange API and governed by [Stack Exchange’s Privacy Policy](https://stackexchange.com/legal/privacy).

The Application does **not** store your Stack Exchange credentials or content locally or remotely.

**Opt-Out Rights**

You can stop all collection of anonymized data by uninstalling the Application. You may use the standard uninstall processes as available on your mobile device or via the application marketplace.

**Data Retention Policy**

No personally identifiable data is stored or retained by the Service Provider. Aggregated analytics and crash logs are retained only by the third-party services listed above, according to their own data retention policies.

**Children**

The Service Provider does not use the Application to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13.

If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact the Service Provider at ander.goig+octostack@icloud.com and appropriate action will be taken.

**Security**

The Service Provider is concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your data. The Application relies on secure third-party tools to manage crash logs, analytics, and subscriptions.

**Changes**

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. The Service Provider will notify users of any changes by updating this page. You are advised to review this policy periodically for any updates. Continued use of the Application constitutes acceptance of the changes.

This privacy policy is effective as of 2025-08-02.
